# SentimentAnalysis
"Acadmemic Project"

Language: IPython (Python 2)

Dataset: I have used amazon product review data to train and test my sentiment analysis model. The dataset, that is used to train and test the model can be found through the given link. http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/amazon_readme.txt

The project analyses the sentiment of user given text and will categories the sentiment of the text into positive or negative.
The sentiment analysis model was trained using Support Vector Machine (SVM) using available datasets of product reviews. The developed model for text analysis incorporates SVM to assign weighted sentiment scores to analyze and classify user given text into negative or positive sentiments.

Sentiment Analysis is the examination of any document using a machine to determine and evaluate the overall conceptual polarity of a document and a user's sentiment on various levels. It computationally categorizes the entire document, and also determines the sentiment of any piece of writing into the positive, negative or neutral category.

The development code was written using Jupyter Notebook.
